<p>Hello and welcome to my personal space on the web!
I'm <u>Pathlavath Vasantha</u>, a graduate from Hyderabad.
With a passion for creativity, code, and connection, I blend technology and aesthetics in everything I do.<pre>
From doodling my thoughts to building simple Python programs, I love expressing myself in different forms.</pre>
My journey is filled with curiosity, growth, and the joy of learning something new every day.
Whether it's designing a collage or exploring a new tech skill, I bring heart into every detail.
Take a look around – there's a little bit of everything that defines me!</p>
<h2 id="ABOUT"><u>ABOUT</u></h2>
<p>I'm a proud graduate from Government Degree College for Girls, Begumpet, where I completed my academic journey with dedication.
Throughout my course, I explored coding, creativity, and communication — three things that truly inspire me.<pre></pre>
I’ve learned Python, created ATS-friendly resumes, and built simple yet meaningful static web content.<pre></pre>
I also enjoy expressing myself through doodles, nature photography, and aesthetic digital collages.
Every experience has shaped me — not just as a student, but as a curious, evolving person.
I’m ready to take on the next chapter with confidence and creativity.</p>
<h2 id="PORT"><u>PORT</u></h2>
<p>My portfolio is a blend of creativity and code.
On the creative side, I love designing aesthetic Instagram posts, doodles, and picture-in-picture collages with a minimalist vibe.
I enjoy turning simple visuals into expressive art that speaks emotions.<pre></pre>
On the technical front, I’ve learned the basics of Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<pre></pre>
I’ve worked on beginner projects like time converters, type checkers, and interactive web elements.<pre></pre>
Combining code with creativity helps me bring ideas to life in both functional and beautiful ways.
Every project I create is a step forward in my learning and self-expression</p>
